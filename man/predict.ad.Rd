\usage{
predict(ad_obj, df, ignore_col = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ad}{An ad object}

\item{df}{A data frame of chemical descriptors}

\item{ignore_col}{Columns that will not be preprocessed, given as a character
vector. This will likely constitute the response variable. The default is
\code{ignore_col = NA}.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of the row indices of X-outliers
}
\description{
\code{predict.ad} takes a data frame of chemical descriptors and returns the
indices of the molecules that are X-outliers. The determination of outliers
uses a method from a 2015 paper by Roy, Kar, and Ambare that can be found
here: \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2015.04.013}.

\details{
The first step is to standardize the values. This can be accomplished by
creating an \code{"ad"} class object using \verb{[ad()]}. This creates a list of the
means and standard deviations of training data. It is important to only call
\code{ad} on training data because in model-building, the testing data should be
used for evaluation and not be considered in the model-building phase.

\code{predict.ad} will use the information in the \code{"ad"} object and standardize
the descriptor. It will return the descriptors as centered and scaled (mean
of 0 and standard deviation of 1). Additionally, this will be converted to
absolute values. accomplished using \code{center_scale_zero} and returning the Let
the standardized value corresponding to descriptor \code{i} of molecule \code{k} be
referred to as \code{s_ik}.

Next, the maximum deviation of each molecule needs to be found. This requires
examining the entries rowwise. If the maximum \code{s_ik} values is less than 3,
the molecule is not an X-outlier. If the minimum \code{s_ik} is greater than 3,
the molecules is an X-outlier. If the minimum is less than 3 and the maximum
is greater than 3, we recalculate \code{s_newk}.

\code{s_newk} is given as the mean of \code{s_ik} values for molecule \code{k} added to 1.28
times the standard deviation of the \code{s_ik} values for molecule \code{k}. If this
is less than 3, then \code{k} is not an X-outlier.

The function only returns a vector of booleans. To remove the X-outliers in a
data set and return the cleaned data frame, use the function
\verb{[remove_xoutlier()]}.

The data frame may have columns that are not chemical descriptors. To handles
this, use the parameter \code{ignore_col} with a vector of the names of the
columns to ignore (as characters) in the process. of building the \code{"ad"}
object. Additional columns to ignore can be passed as \verb{ignore_more = }.
